5. Automate & ScheduleUse cron (Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to run daily: crontab -e and add 0 9 * * * /path/to/python3 /path/to/run1.py --symbols symbolsALL.txt.
Email results using smtplib or integrate with Telegram/Slack for alerts on high-score stocks.

6. Customize & IterateTweak WEIGHTS (e.g., increase "macd" to 15 for more momentum focus).
Add alerts: If Score >80, print/email "Buy Alert: {symbol}".
Test on historical data: Download older periods and backtest.

If you run into issues or want to add specific features (e.g., email alerts), share the error/output!

4) How to schedule to run at 07:00 Mountain Time (America/Denver)

You asked to run at 07:00 Mountain Time and email. Your server likely runs local time; confirm host timezone. Linux Mint default may be system local timezone. If the headless box is in Mountain Time, simplest is cron:

Cron (crontab)

Edit crontab for the user that runs myenv:

crontab -e
# add line to run daily at 07:00 (server must be set to Mountain Time)
0 7 * * * /home/ben/myenv/bin/python /path/to/GXS_Project/run_report.py --symbols /path/to/symbolsALL.txt --export-dir /path/to/exports --email >> /path/to/exports/cron_run.log 2>&1


If your server is in a different timezone, use TZ in cron or use systemd timer (recommended).

systemd timer (recommended for robustness)

Create /etc/systemd/system/gxs-report.service:

[Unit]
Description=GXS daily report

[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=ben
WorkingDirectory=/home/ben/Desktop/GXS\ Project
ExecStart=/home/ben/myenv/bin/python /home/ben/Desktop/GXS\ Project/run_report.py --symbols symbolsALL.txt --export-dir exports --email


Create /etc/systemd/system/gxs-report.timer:

[Unit]
Description=Run GXS report daily at 07:00 America/Denver

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 07:00:00
# If server timezone differs, you can use Persistent=true and set TimeZone=America/Denver via timedatectl or use systemd's timezone-aware calendar features

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target


Then enable & start:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now gxs-report.timer
sudo systemctl status gxs-report.timer


(If your server is not set to Mountain Time and you want to use OnCalendar with zone: OnCalendar=TZ=America/Denver:*-*-* 07:00:00)

5) Quick notes, improvements & next steps I recommend (prioritized)

SMTP security: use environment variables for credentials or a secrets manager. Add retries on email send and better logging.

SQLite cache: store historical enrichments in a sqlite DB so you can compute freshness, avoid repeated downloads, and enable delta-based updates.

Parallel downloads: your batch_download_symbols uses threads — consider processes or async for heavy loads and implement a per-batch rate limiter to avoid yfinance throttling.

Backtester integration: keep your run_backtest() but feed it the same quantum scoring logic to evaluate score thresholds — you already had that; I can add improved metrics (Sharpe, Win rate) next.

Dashboard front-end: later replace static HTML with a tiny Flask app or a static site generator plus saved CSVs if you prefer S3 hosting.

Unit tests & CI: add small tests for compute_rsi, forecast_price_multi and enrich_from_df to avoid regressions.

Logging: switch print() to Python logging with rotating file handler for production traceability.

Monitoring: add an email or webhook on failures > critical (script exception / SMTP failure).
